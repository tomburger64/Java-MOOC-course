/* Create a class named Room. Add the variables private String code and private int seats to the class. Then create a constructor public Room(String classCode, int numberOfSeats) through which values are assigned to the instance variables.

Room

-code:String
-numberOfSeats:int

+Room(String,int)

This class doesn't do much either. However, in the following exercise the object instantiated from our class is already capable of printing text.*/


import java.util.Scanner;

public class MainProgram {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Follow the instructions carefully 
        // and run the tests.
    }
