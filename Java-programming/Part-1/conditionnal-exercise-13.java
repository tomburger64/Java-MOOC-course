/* A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. However, if the year is divisible by 100, then it is a leap year only when it is also divisible by 400.

Write a program that reads a year from the user, and checks whether or not it is a leap year.

Give a year: 2011
The year is not a leap year.

Give a year: 2012
The year is a leap year.

Give a year: 1800
The year is not a leap year.

Give a year: 2000
The year is a leap year. */
