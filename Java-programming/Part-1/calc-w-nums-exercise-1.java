/* In the exercise template, implement a program that asks the user for the number of days. After that, the program prints the number of seconds in the given number of days.

Earlier we learned to read an integer in the following manner:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("Give a number:");
int number = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());
System.out.println("You gave " + number);

Examples of expected output:
How many days would you like to convert to seconds?
1
86400

How many days would you like to convert to seconds?
3
259200

How many days would you like to convert to seconds?
7
604800 */
