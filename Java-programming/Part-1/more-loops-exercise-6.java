/* Implement a program which calculates the factorial of a number given by the user.

Factorial of n, denoted n!, is calculated as 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n. For example, the factorial of 4 is 24 or 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24. Additionally, it has been specified that the factorial of 0 is 1, so 0! = 1.

Sample output:

Give a number: 3
Factorial: 6

The internal calculation here was 1 * 2 * 3 = 6

Give a number: 10
Factorial: 3628800

And now the internal calculation was 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * 8 * 9 * 10 = 3628800 */
